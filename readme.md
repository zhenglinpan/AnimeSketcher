This project uses deep learning methods to transform final films of an animation back into sketchs.

本项目的目的是使用深度学习的方法把动画的最终画面变换回原画。

Currently the model is implemented with cycleGAN and a pretrained model can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NwKzV5UxqBrgXHCXa_r6WzJcV8XbRlNO/view?usp=sharing).

Dataset is not able to be made public due to potential copyright issues, unfortunately, but you can test the model provided or train your own model instead with implemented code, in such case, a few work need to be done on the code.

Test the model with
```python
python test.py --mode test --patch 4
```
